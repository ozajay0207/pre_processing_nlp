s
Greece
and
India.
The
word
"
atom"
"
atom"
was
coined
by
ancient
Greek
philosophers.
However
,
these
ideas
were
founded
in
philosophical
and
theological
reasoning
rather
than
evidence
and
experimentation.
As
a
result
,
their
views
on
what
atoms
look
like
and
how
they
behave
were
incorrect.
They
also
could
not
convince
everybody
,
so
atomism
was
but
one
of
a
number
of
competing
theories
on
the
nature
of
matter.
It
was
not
until
the
19th
century
that
the
idea
was
embraced
and
refined
by
scientists
,
when
the
blossoming
science
of
chemistry
produced
discoveries
that
only
the
concept
of
atoms
could
explain.
In
the
early
1800s
,
John
Dalton
used
the
concept
of
atoms
to
explain
why
elements
always
react
in
ratios
of
small
whole
numbers
(
the
law
of
multiple
proportions
)
.
For
instance
,
there
are
two
types
of
tin
oxide:
one
is
88.1%
tin
and
11.9%
oxygen
and
the
other
is
78.7%
tin
and
21.3%
oxygen
(
tin(II
)
oxide
and
tin
dioxide
respectively
)
.
This
means
that
100g
of
tin
will
combine
either
with
13.5g
or
27g
of
oxygen.
13.5
and
27
form
a
ratio
of
1:2
,
a
ratio
of
small
whole
numbers.
This
common
pattern
in
chemistry
suggested
to
Dalton
that
elements
react
in
whole
number
multiples
of
discrete
units—in
other
words
,
atoms.
In
the
case
of
tin
oxides
,
one
tin
atom
will
combine
with
either
one
or
two
oxygen
atoms.
Dalton
also
believed
atomic
theory
could
explain
why
water
absorbs
different
gases
in
different
proportions.
For
example
,
he
found
that
water
absorbs
carbon
dioxide
far
better
than
it
absorbs
nitrogen.
Dalton
hypothesized
this
was
due
to
the
differences
in
mass
and
complexity
of
the
gase
'

respective
particles.
Indeed
,
carbon
dioxide
molecules
(
CO
)
are
heavier
and
larger
than
nitrogen
molecules
(
N
)
)
In
1827
,
botanist
Robert
Brown
used
a
microscope
to
look
at
dust
grains
floating
in
water
and
discovered
that
they
moved
about
erratically
,
a
phenomenon
that
became
known
as
"
Brownian
motio
"
.
This
was
thought
to
be
caused
by
water
molecules
knocking
the
grains
about.
In
1905
Albert
Einstein
proved
the
reality
of
these
molecules
and
their
motions
by
producing
the
first
Statistical
physics
analysis
of
Brownian
motion.
French
physicist
Jean
Perrin
used
Einstei
'
s
work
to
experimentally
determine
the
mass
and
dimensions
of
atoms
,
thereby
conclusively
verifying
Dalto
'
s
atomic
theory.
The
physicist
J.
J.
Thomson
measured
the
mass
of
cathode
rays
,
showing
they
were
made
of
particles
,
but
were
around
1800
times
lighter
than
the
lightest
atom
,
hydrogen.
Therefore
,
they
were
not
atoms
,
but
a
new
particle
,
the
first
"
subatomic"
"
subatomic"
particle
to
be
discovered
,
which
he
originally
called
"
"corpuscle""
"
"corpuscle""
but
was
later
named
"electron"
,
after
particles
postulated
by
George
Johnstone
Stoney
in
1874.
He
also
showed
they
were
identical
to
particles
given
off
by
photoelectric
and
radioactive
materials.
It
was
quickly
recognized
that
they
are
the
particles
that
carry
electric
currents
in
metal
wires
,
and
carry
the
negative
electric
charge
within
atoms.
Thomson
was
given
the
1906
Nobel
Prize
in
Physics
for
this
work.
Thus
he
overturned
the
belief
that
atoms
are
the
indivisible
,
ultimate
particles
of
matter.
Thomson
also
incorrectly
postulated
that
the
low
mass
,
negatively
charged
electrons
were
distributed
throughout
the
atom
in
a
uniform
sea
of
positive
charge.
This
became
known
as
the
plum
pudding
model
.
This
is
a
Short.
word.
In
1909
,
Hans
Geiger
and
Ernest
Marsden
,
under
the
direction
of
Ernest
Rutherford
,
bombarded
a
metal
foil
with
alpha
particles
to
observe
how
they
scattered.
They
expected
all
the
alpha
particles
to
pass
straight
through
with
little
deflection
,
because
Thomso
'
s
model
said
that
the
charges
in
the
atom
are
so
diffuse
that
their
electric
fields
could
not
affect
the
alpha
particles
much.
However
,
Geiger
and
Marsden
spotted
alpha
particles
being
deflected
by
angles
greater
than
90°
,
which
was
supposed
to
be
impossible
according
to
Thomso
'
s
model.
To
explain
this
,
Rutherford
proposed
that
the
positive
charge
of
the
atom
is
concentrated
in
a
tiny
nucleus
at
the
center
of
the
atom.
While
experimenting
with
the
products
of
radioactive
decay
,
in
1913
radiochemist
Frederick
Soddy
discovered
that
there
appeared
to
be
more
than
one
type
of
atom
at
each
position
on
the
periodic
table.
The
term
isotope
was
coined
by
Margaret
Todd
as
a
suitable
name
for
different
atoms
that
belong
to
the
same
element.
J.J.
Thomson
created
a
technique
for
separating
atom
types
through
his
work
on
ionized
gases
,
which
subsequently
led
to
the
discovery
of
stable
isotopes.

Mr.ABC
is
smart.
